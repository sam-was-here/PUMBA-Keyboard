Located here is the FreeCAD model and STLs for the case of the PUMBA-Keyboard. There are two parts to the case: the main case and the face. You can 3D print them for yourself. If I recall correctly, there is a mistake in the case model that interferes with the components and the PCB. To work around this problem, you can use a Dremel tool to fix the 3D model or modify it in FreeCAD.
